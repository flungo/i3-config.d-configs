# flungo's i3-config.d

These are my personal i3 configurations which I use in conjunction with the [i3-config.d](https://github.com/flungo/i3-config.d) script that I wrote. These can be used as example and inspriation for creating your own i3 configuration files.

## Configurations

* `00-base.conf` basic configurations for i3 setting up variables and allowing for minimal usability.
* `10-windows.conf` configurations for window management.
* `10-workspaces.conf` configurations for workspace management.
* `20-mouse.conf` configurations for using mouse with i3.
* `30-resize-mode.conf` resize mode configuration.
* `40-bar.conf` i3bar configuration.
